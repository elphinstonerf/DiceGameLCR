***** Rules of the dice game: Left Center Right *****

- To play this game there must be a minimum of 3 players.
- The players should then be positioned in a circle.
- Every player will be given a total of 3 chips. 
- The amount of chip each player has on their turn will determine the number of dice they 
  have to roll.
- The First player (Who should have 3 chips) rolls 3 dice.
- The player must follow the roll result of each dice they have rolled.
- Each dice is a 6 sided die with unique sides for this game. The sides and their outcomes 
  are represented below:

	 "L" = Left: Player must pass one chip to the player on your left.
	
	 "C" = Center: Player must pass one chip to the center pot. (No one recieves this chip)

	 "R" = Right: Player must pass one chip to the player on their right.

	 "*" = Dot: Player gets to keep one chip.

- Once the player has finished performing their roll result, the next player on the left 
  will be the next to play.
- The next player will now roll the amount of dice depending on how many chips they have. 
  (Never more than 3 dice are rolled)
- If a player does not have any chips, they do not roll any dice. However, they are still 
  in the game. This is because they have the chance of being given chips by other players, 
  which will allow them to possibly roll on their next turn.
- Once only one player has any amount of chips and all the other players have zero, the 
  player with chips still Wins!
